# Employee-Payroll-Tracker

## Description

This application allows employers to better manage their payroll by entering each employeeâ€™s name, and salary. Each function will render a series of prompts, gathering this information and storing it in an array of objects, then rendering it on the screen. After this, the console will display the average salary. This was achieved mainly by using a do-while loop, the Math function, and template strings.
